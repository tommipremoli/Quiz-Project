# Quiz Project
This project develops an interactive film quiz based on a dataset of titles, genres, directors and actors. After cleaning and formatting the data, the user chooses the difficulty (easy or difficult) and answers questions about the selected films. The quiz offers four answer options and tracks the score, showing a final graph of the answers' performance.
